Welcome to NeuroSimGoNoGo, a Reinforcement Learning Framework for Go/No-Go Task Simulation.

## Overview

NeuroSimGoNoGo is a Python-based simulator designed for experimenting with different strategies in a go/no-go task simulation. It allows users to explore the performance of pre-built strategies and compare them to a learning agent.

## Features

- **Strategy Exploration**: Test and compare various strategies, from random actions to sophisticated learning agents.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the accumulation of tracking variables over trials.
- **Flexible Experimentation**: Easily modify the number of trials, strategy functions, and tracked variables.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NeuroSimGoNoGo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd NeuroSimGoNoGo
    ```

3. Run the experiment:

    ```bash
    python neuro_simulator.py
    ```

4. Explore the results and enjoy the journey into the world of reinforcement learning!
